WA is an educational project front and back, designed not just to make learning simpler but also to re-immerse its developers in the course material during its development. Walkthrough Assistâ€™s core features are providing supplemental information alongside course walkthroughs, detailed timestamps for quick reference, must-know concepts in plain language, and additional resources (w3schools, tutorials, MDN Web Docs).",
